BUILDING
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

(The order is important here)
- Install Visual studio 2017 Community Edition: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
- Open visual studio. Menu "Tools / Get Tools and Features"
- Install the Visual studio 2015 build toolset

- Install CUDA Toolkit 10.1 https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
If you install this before visual studio 2017 and the 2015 toolset, you need to reinstall it to make sure the CUDA BuildCustomizations are installed.

- Download the external libraries below and extract in the root. There should be a folder "external" in the repository root.

- In visual studio, open the smlm.sln. 
- Set the build to release mode, and build SMLMLibTest. This will also build the main library (SMLMLib)
- The final dll is smlm_cuda.dll, which will be in x64/Release or x64/Debug

- For the python part, Anaconda 3 is recommended. Make sure to get python >= 3.6 on 64 bit.

Notes:
CUDA 10.1 and Visual Studio 2017 builds are incompatible currently due what seems like a CUDA compiler bug, so we're using the Visual Studio 2015 build mode of 2017 to build the library.
